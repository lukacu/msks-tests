MSKS - reproducible task execution (tests)
==========================================

MSKS (short for Meeseek) is a lightweight Python tool for running interdependent tasks in a reproducible manner. Reproducible environments are created using Conda, the source code for the task is pinned to a specific version in a given repository.

This repository contains tests for the MSKS workers, but also serves as a lightweight example how to create a compatible repository with code that can be run as tasks. The main library is available `here <https://github.com/lukacu/msks>`_.
